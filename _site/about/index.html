			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I am a Computer Science major and Econmic minor at North Carolina State University, graduating in December of 2016. I am currently interning at Bioventus as an Integration Architect. My focus is processing data using RESTful calls in Dell Boomi to convert SAP, XML, and JSON data types which will update cloud services for Bioventus. I have started a few projects that include Docusign, Workday, and SharePoint.</p>
			<br/>
			<p>I am the current President and Coach of the Cross Country and Track Club at NC State. I spend time developing specific training plans ranging from the 800m to the 8k. Our men's team has had incredible success, with consecutive Southeast Regional titles in 2014 and 2015, finishing 11th in the nation in 2015.&nbsp;</p>
