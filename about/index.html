        <h1>About</h1>

            I graduated from North Carolina State University in December of 2016 with a B.S. in Computer Science and Economic minor.
            I formerly interned at Bioventus as an Integration Architect. My focus was processing data using RESTful calls in Dell Boomi to convert SAP, XML, and JSON data types which will update cloud services for Bioventus.
            I  developed applications to consume data from Docusign, Workday, and SharePoint to help support internal services at Bioventus.

            I was the 2016 President and Coach of the Cross Country and Track Club at NC State.
            I spent time developing specific training plans ranging from the 800m to the 8k.
            Our men's and women's team is incredibly successful.
            The men won the Southeast Regional titles from 2014-2016, finishing 12th in the nation in 2015 and 2016.
            The women won their first regional title in 2016, after improving on 3rd and 2nd place finishes in 214 and 2015, respectively.
            In 2015, the women finished 11th in the nation.&nbsp;</p>
