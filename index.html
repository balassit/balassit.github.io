I hope to encourage learning of multiple topics, and demonstrate the skills that I have obtained in computer science. This site also gives me the ability to continue my journey of improving my crafts; as a central repository for my thoughts, and endeavors. UI/UX are certainly areas to be improved, however, the content that I intend to write will hopefully inspire creativity.
