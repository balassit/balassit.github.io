Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. jk, I struggled for hours because I didn't check my email...Never verified my account with GitDumb. So never forget to do that.
