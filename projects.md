### [Human Computer Interaction]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/greenbeans)
In this project, I worked with two other team members to develop an android application 
using scenario based design principles. The goal of the project was to create an 
application that is developed with the user in mind during the entire process. 
Usability rules and heuristics were followed to provide pleasant and simple interactions
for the user.
