### [Human Computer Interaction]({{page.url}}/greenbeans)In this project, I worked with two other team members to develop an android application 
using scenario based design principles. The goal of the project was to create an 
application that is developed with the user in mind during the entire process. 
Usability rules and heuristics were followed to provide pleasant and simple interactions
for the user.

### [Senior Design Project]({{page.url}}/seniorproject)
In this project, I was the team lead of a a group of four seniors at NC State University. 
We created an application for the security team at Interactive Intelligence, now part of Genesys.
Our objective was to centralize data related to security vulnerability, typically 
loaded into a chat window with minimal ability to record a history of which alerts had been mitigated.
