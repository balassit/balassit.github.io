## Introduction

1. Be a student of the game. Do not seek fame as you will find hollowness with the result.
2. Teach with the same devotion and level of detail to novices as you would the masters.
3. The study of "form to leave form"
 - learn the fundamentals first
 - Eventually the fundamentals are processed unconsciously. The cycle continues as you develop
  
4. Break down abstract ideas incrementally to see the steps. This is what masters must do to explain the
things that they have been doing unconsciously so that novices can see the steps. Helps to develop this 
model so that you understand what it is that you are doing.

## Chapter 1: Innocent Moves

When he thought about the people that were watching as he played he lost his flow and played poorly. Many people 
say that you are "in the zone", and when you break out it is challenging to regain yourself to how you approach play.
He could concentrate in the environment that he was familiar with better than 
at home because he was used to the noise. 

 - Teach with discipline without discouraging a student's voice
 - Don't force them into a mold that you have created. Teach the student, not the process.
 - Experience should be about learning and passion first, then competition later on. This is why children should not 
 be trained to win at an early age, but rather on learning the fundamentals and growing their passion.

## Chapter 2: Losing to Win

 - You can learn from your failures; must be able to frame with properly
 - Give time away to reconnect after great wins or failures

## Chapter 3: Two Approaches to Learning
 - Reflection question: What is the difference that allows some to fit into that narrow window to the top?
 What is the point? If ambition spells probably disappointment, why pursue excellence?
 
 Have a well-thought-out approach that inspires resilience, the ability to make connections between diverse pursuits, and day-to-day enjoyment of the process.
 
### **Entity vs Incremental Theory of Intelligence**

**Entity Theory**: Influenced by parents and teaches. Would say "I'm smart at this." 
Attribute success or failure to brain and unalterable ability. Think that intelligence is a fixed entity.

**Incremental or Learning Theory**: Attribute success or failure to effort. "I got it because I worked hard." 
"I should've worked harder." Hard work allows for a novice to become a master.

**Entity**: More prone to quit when things become difficult rather having a mastery oriented response.
Can feel helpless under difficult situation and self confidence can be tarnished. 
Feel the need live up to or maintain image that will inevitably be shattered. Promotes narrower focus and that the immediate 
win is more important than long term sustainability. 

 - Child is told they did **well** when they **succeed**
 - Child is told they **are not good** at something when they **failed**
 
Don't dismiss poor performance and reward success. This leads to a mindset that you are ood at one thing and bad at another.

**Incremental**: Process oriented approach - effort leads to success. Learning is a journey and the teacher is there to assist.
Focus is on long term development instead of quick results. What happens when you fail at what you were "supposed" to be good at? 

 - Embrace organic long term learning process
 - Don't live in a shell of mediocrity; growth comes at the expense of comfort or safety
   + example is the hermit crab who abandons shell
 - Gain from your experiences along the way; it will lead to happiness.

### **Focusing on the End Game**

Many will start with the beginning of the game as the starting point with the immediate goal to win as soon as possible.
Start in different situations with reduced complexity and clear principles. 
Define a purpose at the start.
 
## Chapter 4: Loving the Game
 
 - Put yourself out there. DO not be afraid to damage ego with losing
 - Short term goals can be useful if they're balanced with a nurturing, long term philosophy
 - Need to be psychologically prepared to face the challenges that come our way. Competition is not a bad thing; 
 it helps prepare us for this.
 
 To say that losing does not matter can be an insult when it clearly does to the loser. 
 Learn how to respond properly to the situation.
 
### **Balancing long term process, short term goals, and inevitable setbacks**
  
 -  Compete in a healthy manner
    + Coach can be help by internalizing process oriented approach by making everyday feedback respond to effort over the result.
 - Do not deny the chance to enjoy the moment by being an authoritarian. 
    + We are human and should embrace celebration as a natural part of enjoying victory
 - Give empathy for loses. Console them. Can ask if they know what happened? Did you lose concentration?
    + Leave technical questions for later
