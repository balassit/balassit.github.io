title: "Peak Performance Notes"

As I read Peak Performance, by Brad Stulberg and Steve Magness, I will provide what I find useful from the book, 
or notable points that I disagree with. I will also inject my own ideas as they surface through each section. 

## Introduction

### Competing Against The Machines

You make a very bold and seemingly uninformed view on technology. We do not compete against technology. 
Computers (technology) enables so many advances of which you are certainly aware. 
Eliminating jobs to advances in technology increases global wealth. I still love a very simple anecdote:
A man was told that a group of men were given picks and shovels in order to lengthen the work of construction 
(rather than machinery), to which he replied why not give them spoons and forks instead of picks and shovels 
if the object was to lengthen the time to complete the job.

We are in a world where creativity will inspire new works to which jobs will be created. 
My worry is that you extend fearing expansions of technology and some absurd war that is 
mounted by means I do not understand.

### Key Take-aways

**1. At what cost will be push ourselves to levels that are beyond our natural limit?**

Succumbing to pressure: over-use of medication or performance enhancing supplements comes with unintended side effects.
Our bodies have a natural state and medication can be used to correct imbalances, however, the consequences of these corrections 
can lead to a more negative than positive result.

Taking an easy way out of stress by getting medication may correct the imbalance, but you may lose the opportunity to 
learn how to modify your behavior, determine the root cause, and cope with the issue at hand. Certainly, there are cases where 
medication is necessary, and there is compassion for those that require it.

**2. Burnout is real, and can be avoided**

Do you find yourself working through the night? Are you obsessed with your goals? Leading you to find ways to get by on less 
sleep, relaxation, friends, or enjoyment? You may tell yourself that these are worth sacrificing for your goal, because 
let's face it, that's what you want and you won't stop until you get it. Wake up and smell the fire!

Take your lunch break! An hour. And not at your desk. Eat with friends. Set boundaries for when and where you take on these goals. 
Ask yourself if this is what you really want, and why. What makes this something to obtain? Often in life we set out on a path, 
and are able to reach our goal, but are left unsatisfied with it. It was not what we really thought it would be.

However, you can be consumed by your passions. Watch for an `upcoming article` on what passion is and how it relates to your goals.
