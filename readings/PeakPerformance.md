title: "Peak Performance Notes"

As I read Peak Performance, by Brad Stulberg and Steve Magness, I will provide what I find useful from the book, 
or notable points that I disagree with.

### Competing Against The Machines

You make a very bold and seemingly uninformed view on technology. We do not compete against technology. 
Computers (technology) enables so many advances that of which you are certainly aware. 
Eliminating jobs to advances in technology increases global wealth. I still love a very simple anecdote:
A man was told that a group of men were given picks and shovels in order to lengthen the work of construction 
(rather than machinery), to which he replied why not give them spoons and forks instead of picks and shovels 
if the object was to lengthen the time to complete the job.

We are in a world where creativity will inspire new works to which jobs will be created. 
My worry is that you extend fearing expansions of technology and some absurd war that is 
mounted by means I do not understand.
